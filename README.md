# Weather-Dashboard

This was a super challenging exercise. I felt like the best aveneue for me to approach it would be to attack small sections at a time. Pretty proud of how it turned out and my problem solving abilities.

-got the initial setup and file folders straight
-set up a grid for the project
-pseudo code
-banner set up along with the css behind it
-making good progress, got the buttons to populate correctly dynamically
-got the html set up 
-local storage like a BOSS!
-making a lot of progress with the weather side of it.have the current set up and need to get to the UV index. I am saving the icons for later.
-have the five day forcast about straight. the icon on the main page is working and need to do the same on the five day
-got the uv index working correctly.  had problems with the order of operation and once I figured that out it was pretty smooth sailing.
-got the icons sorted out now for the five day
-uv index was repeating itself, had to get it cleared
